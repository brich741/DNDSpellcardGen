Since DND Beyond doesn't have an easy way to print spell cards, I created a very simple plug in to read my spells on my character sheet and pipe the spell list over to https://hardcodex.ru/ to make printing these easier.

It's a chrome exstension so you have to use chrome.
This will only work with the 2024 spells that https://hardcodex.ru/ has - so no custom spells, artificer is likely out also.  

This project was built for me for my needs as a quick and dirty tool. 
You're free to use it , change it, whatever.





INSTALL

Download the Dnd Exstension folder somewhere on your computer
enable developer options in chrome exstension area 
click the option to 'load unpacked' in the top left of the exstentions screen
select the folder 'Dnd Exstension' where ever you put it

USE

go to your character sheet on DNDbeyond.com and click on the spells tab
